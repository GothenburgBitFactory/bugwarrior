Getting bugwarrior
==================

.. _requirements:

Requirements
------------

To use bugwarrior, you need python 2.7 and taskwarrior. Upon installation, the
setup script will automatically download and install missing python
dependencies.

Note that some of those dependencies have a C extension module (e.g. the
``cryptography`` package).  If those packages are not yet present on your
system, the setup script will try to build them locally, for which you will
need a C compiler (e.g. ``gcc``) and the necessary header files (python and,
for the cryptography package, openssl).
A convenient way to install those is to use your usual package manager
(``dnf``, ``yum``, ``apt``, etc).
Header files are installed from development packages (e.g.  ``python-devel``
and ``openssl-devel`` on Fedora or ``python-dev`` ``libssl-dev`` on Debian).

Installing from the Python Package Index
----------------------------------------

By default, ``bugwarrior`` will be installed with support for the following
services: Bitbucket, Github, Gitlab, Pagure, Phabricator, Redmine, Teamlab, and
Versionone. There is optional support for Jira, Megaplan.ru, Active Collab,
Debian BTS, Trac, Bugzilla, and but those require extra dependencies that are
installed by specifying ``bugwarrior[service]`` in the commands above. For
example, if you want to use bugwarrior with Jira::
