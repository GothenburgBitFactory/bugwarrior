Bitbucket
=========

You can import tasks from your Bitbucket instance using
the ``bitbucket`` service name.

Example Service
---------------

Here's an example of an Bitbucket target::

    [my_issue_tracker]
    service = bitbucket
    bitbucket.username = ralphbean
    bitbucket.password = mypassword

The above example is the minimum required to import issues from
Bitbucket.  You can also feel free to use any of the
configuration options described in :ref:`common_configuration_options`.

Service Features
----------------

Sync with a team
++++++++++++++++

If the ``bitbucket.username`` is the name of a team, you may use it with::

    bitbucket.is_team = True

Include and Exclude Certain Repositories
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you happen to be working with a large number of projects, you
may want to pull issues from only a subset of your repositories.  To
do that, you can use the ``bitbucket.include_repos`` option.

For example, if you would like to only pull-in issues from
your ``project_foo`` and ``project_fox`` repositories, you could add
this line to your service configuration::

    bitbucket.include_repos = project_foo,project_fox

Alternatively, if you have a particularly noisy repository, you can
instead choose to import all issues excepting it using the
``bitbucket.exclude_repos`` configuration option.

In this example, ``noisy_repository`` is the repository you would
*not* like issues created for::

    bitbucket.exclude_repos = noisy_repository

Please note that the API returns all lowercase names regardless of
the case of the repository in the web interface.

Filter Pull Requests
++++++++++++++++++++

Although you can filter issues using :ref:`common_configuration_options`,
pull requests are not filtered by default.  You can filter pull requests
by adding the following configuration option::

    bitbucket.filter_pull_requests = True
